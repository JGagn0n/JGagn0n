- 👋 Hey, I’m Justin Gagnon. I'm primarily a mobile developer right now but I dabble in lots of other tech.
- 🎨 In my free time I paint tabletop miniatures for Warhammer AOS and Star Wars Legion
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Electron to build a collection app for retro games
- 🐦 Find me on twitter [@JGagn0](https://twitter.com/jgagn0)
- I'm not currently looking for contract work or a new position, but feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/justin-gagnon-5155612a).

**As privileged people in tech, we all have the obligation to be allies to work towards equality for all marginalized people and stand up for others experiencing harassment.**
