- 👋 Hey, I’m Justin Gagnon. I'm primarily a mobile developer right now but I dabble in lots of other tech.
- 🎮 I co-founded a video game studio named Sky Daddy Games!
- 🎨 In my free time I paint tabletop miniatures for Warhammer AOS, Star Wars Legion, and Marvel Crisis Protocol.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal Engine, VR via UE4, Python, and blockchain.
- 🐦 Find me on twitter [@JGagn0](https://twitter.com/jgagn0)
- I'm not currently looking for contract work or a new position, but feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/justin-gagnon-5155612a).

** As privileged people in tech, we all have the obligation to be allies to work towards equality for all marginalized people and stand up for others experiencing harassment. **
